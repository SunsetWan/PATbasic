(b) The vector named ‘v2’ has ten elements and each element is the default value 0.
(c) The vector named ‘v3’ has ten elements and each element is the value of 42.
(d) The vector named ‘v4’ has only one element that has the value 10.
(e) The vector named ‘v5’ has two elements whose values are 10 and 42.
(f) The vector named ‘v6’ has ten default-initialized elements.
(g) The vector named ‘v7’ has ten elements and each element whose type is _String_ has the value of “hi”.
